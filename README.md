# Server Boilerplates Repository

This repository contains a collection of server boilerplates for rapid development and deployment. It includes templates for servers built in Java with Spring Boot, Python with Flask, and Node.js. Each directory contains a generic setup that can be used as a starting point for creating a server application in the respective programming language.

## Directory Structure

- `GenericGraphQL-MongoDB`: A template for setting up a GraphQL server with MongoDB integration in Node.js.
- `JavaSpringGeneric-MongoDB/Write-Relief-api`: A Spring Boot boilerplate setup for RESTful API services with MongoDB.
- `MySQL-GenericServer`: A generic server setup for MySQL database interactions using Node.js & Handlebars.
- `Python_Flask/app`: A Flask application boilerplate for quick Python server setups.
- `connection.js`: A Node.js module for handling database connections.
- `server.js`: The main server file for a Node.js application using express.

## Getting Started

To use these boilerplates, clone the repository and navigate to the directory that matches your desired stack.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the relevant programming language and package managers installed:
  - Java: JDK and Maven
  - Python: Python and pip
  - Node.js: Node.js and npm or yarn

## Installation

Here is a quick start guide for each boilerplate:

## Java Spring Boot

Navigate to the `JavaSpringGeneric-MongoDB/Write-Relief-api` directory:

```bash
cd JavaSpringGeneric-MongoDB/Write-Relief-api
```
nstall the dependencies using Maven:
```bash
mvn install
```
Run the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Python Flask
Navigate to the Python_Flask/app directory:

```bash
cd Python_Flask/app
``````
Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the Flask application:
```bash
flask run
```

## Node.js

Navigate to the root directory where server.js is located:

```bash
cd path/to/server
```
Install the dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Node.js server:

```bash
node server.js
```
